# WikiRandomizer
Random article option from Wikipedia

Thank you for looking at this learning experience. 

The main goal behind this project was to learn how to webscrape Wikipedia.

What is it?
The program offers up a random Article name that, if you are interested, it will open up a new browser with the link.
In the case you aren't running on your local machine, it will provide the link for reference that you can easily follow.

How it works:
1) The program will offer an initial article name for the user to decide if they are interested.
2) User enters Y or N. If N, the program will offer another random article (if the user requests) for a total of 3 options.
3) Once the user selects Y, it will go to the link and/or provide the link to the Wikipedia article.

Current problems:
1) Based on how the url is created based on the random article, sometimes the program doesn't capture the "-" inside the link.
2) There may be some redundancies that can be corrected.
3) I wanted to supply the references from the random article in a table format, so pandas is still being called for future updates.

Thank you again and I hope you enjoy!
